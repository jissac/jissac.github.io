      <description>In 1912, Mayor Yukio Ozaki of Tokyo gifted 3,000 cherry trees to the city of Washington, DC as a sign of friendship between the US and Japan. Today, the National Cherry Blossom Festival attracts more than a million people each year who come from all over the world to admire the flowering cherry trees.
In light of this amazing history, a few friends and I decided to travel to DC and experience the cherry blossom bloom first-hand.</description>

      <description>Spontaneous road trips are sometimes needed to jolt one out of the rhythm of the regular work week. So one weekend, thatâ€™s what some friends and I decided to do: travel to Pittsburgh on a whim. We left Michigan on Friday night after work, ate Potbelly sandwiches in the car, and slept all the way to Pittsburg. Well, only the passengers slept, thankfully. I had gotten a rough itinerary of fun things to do from my friend who studied at Carnegie Mellon and our dear friend Google had also given helpful suggestions, so we were set.</description>

      <description>I went skiing for the first time at Mt. Brighton (pictured above). Now seasoned skiers might chuckle at these rounded slopes, but for a first-timer like me, these hills looked like the Himalayan peaks. And indeed, although I had watched countless YouTube videos about skiing the week before, the moment I buckled up the rented boots to the skis, my meticulous research and mental preparation melted away.
I signed up for beginners lessons with my group, and after learning the basics, we proceeded to ski down the beginner bunny slope.</description>
